# ðŸ§® Arbitrary Precision Calculator  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The **Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)** is a high-precision arithmetic tool developed in **C**, utilizing **Data Structures** to handle extremely large and small numbers beyond the limitations of standard data types. It efficiently performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** on arbitrarily large numbers using linked lists. This project is ideal for applications in **cryptography, scientific computing, and financial analytics**, where precision is critical.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation  
Standard integer data types in C (like `int`, `long`) have **fixed precision and size constraints**, making them unsuitable for handling extremely large numbers. This calculator overcomes such limitations by:  
- **Using linked lists** to represent numbers of any length  
- **Performing arithmetic operations manually**, digit by digit  
- **Avoiding overflow issues**, ensuring precise calculations  

## âš¡ Features  
âœ… Supports **arbitrarily large numbers** for computation  
âœ… Performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**  
âœ… Implements **linked lists** for efficient memory usage  
âœ… Provides a **command-line interface (CLI)** for easy interaction  
âœ… Displays **step-by-step computation details** for transparency
